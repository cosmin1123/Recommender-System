This thesis presents a recommendation system for articles that are rich in content and have certain attributes. This system was needed because a tool that exploited all the properties of an article, at their maximum potential, was not that accessible. The first step toward choosing an appropriate algorithm for your problem is to decide upon which attributes of your entities you want to focus. Since this is a recommendation system for articles, the main focus is going to be on article content and article categorization. Other recommendation systems take into account only the content of the articles and do not give any importance to the date, author, language, and ratings of an article. Also, most of the already existing recommendation systems create and maintain the data in their own database, thus doubling the required storage space for an application.
