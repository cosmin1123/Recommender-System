This thesis presents a recommendation system for articles that are rich in content and have certain attributes. This system was needed because an open source tool, able of producing both recommended and related articles, was not accessible. The first step towards choosing an appropriate algorithm for your problem is to decide upon which attributes of your entities you want to focus. Since this is a recommendation system for articles, the main focus is going to be on article content and categorization. Other recommendation systems focus only on the content of an article and do not give any importance to it's date, author, language, or ratings. Also, most of the already existing recommendation systems create and maintain the data in their own database, thus increasing the required storage space.
