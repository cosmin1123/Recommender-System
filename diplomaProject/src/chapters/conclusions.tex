\section{Conclusions} 
\label{sec:conclusions}
We proved in this paper that we built a stand-alone application that can give good recommendations and can be easily integrated with any database.

We built a system that takes full advantage of all the existing data and gives the best recommendations for the presented problem.

Also, the importance of each considered attribute can be easily changed and thus we can easily make recommendations of articles made by a certain author, belong to a certain category, belong to the same collection, etc. 

We can combine the recommended articles for a certain user with the related articles, in order to solve the cold start problem and to obtain better results.

\section{Future Development} 
\label{sec:future-development}

In order to further improve the recommendations we could use a neural network to predict what ratings a user would give to the unrated articles. This way, we could better predict the users with similar interests.
